      Replacing a three season cottage that has been in the family for
      generations, this MAFCOhouse is a four season home with extensive views
      from almost every side. The living space and master bedroom share the
      sheer glass lake elevation, while a large bank of windows to the rear
      provides views and transparency through the cottage.

      Large roof overhangs and big decks to front and rear connect with the
      landscape and encourage outdoor living. Guest bedrooms are located in a
      separate wing, connected via a corridor incorporating an office space in
      this compact MAFCO design.
